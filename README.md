# Mainio Survey

This project includes Angular Elements / web component version of the survey tool and also can be exported as Angular library.

Use `npm run build-lib` to build Angular library. It will be exported to `./dist/mainio-survey` folder.

Use `npm run build-gulp` to build the web component. It will be exported to `./dist/gulp` with index.html so you can test it right away.
